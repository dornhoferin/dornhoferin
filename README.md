# 🦊 artist, statistics nerd, coffee addict

- 👋 Hi, I’m `@dornhoferin`
  - **Why `dornhoferin`?**
  
    Because Mr. Dornhofer is my husband, who is a software developer - like me - as well.
    
    Since having two people turn around when one name is called, a proper (and only *slightly* ironic 🦊) distinction was needed.
    
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
  - software development, especially console applications, backend, development of tools, scripting
  - statistics, data science, **proper** interpretation of statistics, machine learning
  - drawing, creative writing, digital photography, reading
  - ☕ coffee, obviously (not only in its consumption, but also in different types of brewing, roasts and such)
  
- 📚 I know ...
  - C#, Python, PowerShell, vanilla JavaScript (+ HTML & CSS basics)
  - applied statistics
  - German, English, Italian, Mandarin Chinese (spoken, not written, mostly)
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  - GUI applications in Python with Kivy
  - R
  - 🇩🇰 dansk
